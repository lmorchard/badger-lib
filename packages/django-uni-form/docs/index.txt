django-uni-form (Django Uni-Form)
=====================================

Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables,
paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
format.

`Uni-form`_ has been selected as the base model for the design of the forms.
 
Django-uni-form lets you easily display Django forms as divs.
