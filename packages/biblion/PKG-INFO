        ==============
        
        Biblion was the eldarion.com blog which we've extracted and open sourced. It
        is currently positioned as being used for site/project blogs such as
        eldarion.com and pinaxproject.com. We intend for this app to replace the
        internal Pinax blog app once we've made it feature complete.
        
        
        Current features include:
        
        * support for multiple channels (e.g. technical vs business)
        * use of Creole as markup format
        * Atom feeds
        * previewing of blog posts before publishing
        * optional ability to announce new posts on twitter
