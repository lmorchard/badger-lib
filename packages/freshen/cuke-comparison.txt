Differences from Cucumber:

- Obviously, there are no magical assertion methods on objects, use nose.tools.* instead
- When calling steps from inside step definitions, you can pass a block of text which will get parsed the same way it does in a real .feature file
- You cannot have multi-line feature or scenario names
